##    Top 10 Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1.  Mental Health vs Addiction
> People with **poor mental health** smoke ~40% more and drink ~20% more than those with good mental health.

### 2.  Income Group vs Smoking
> Individuals earning **< $48K/year** smoke more (~10.5/day) than those earning **> $150K/year** (~9.5/day).

### 3.  Education Level vs Drinking
> People with **Postgraduate** education drink the **least** (~4.8 drinks/week), while **Primary-level** educated drink the **most** (~5.2/week).

### 4.  Exercise Frequency vs Addiction
> Daily exercisers smoke **~9.4/day**, while non-exercisers smoke **~10.6/day**. Exercise reduces addiction behaviors.

### 5.  Age Distribution of Addictive Behaviors
> Smoking peaks in **40â€“60** years, drinking in **30â€“50**. Both habits decline with age.
